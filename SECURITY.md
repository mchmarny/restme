## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send a detailed mail to security@chmarny.com to report vulnerabilities in git, 
even when unsure whether the bug in question is an exploitable vulnerability. 
Vulnerabilities are expected to be discussed only on that list, and not in public, 
until the official announcement on the Git mailing list on the release date.

Examples for details to include:

* short description (or a script) to demonstrate the exploit
* list of affected platforms and scenarios 
* name of the person or company involved in the discovery
* indication whether the vulnerability has already already disclosed
